# About Me

Hello! I'm Ishita Bhatt, a passionate student, currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Applications. I'm working on various projects and assignments to enhance and polish my programming skills plus improvising my command over other Technical Skills. Having a keen interest in working with Python, my goal is to master Python and use it to solve real-world challenges.

# Projects
### [1.Tic-Tac-Toe-Game](https://github.com/ishitabhatt0312/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game)

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty cells with "X" or "O." The goal is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game ends with a win, draw, or when all spaces are filled. Optimal play often results in a draw. 

### [2. Snake-Game](https://github.com/ishitabhatt0312/Snake-Game-)
This project is a classic Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game challenges players to control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food, while avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries. It features smooth animations, real-time score tracking, and increasing difficulty as the snake grows. This project is a fun way to learn game development concepts and Python programming, making it perfect for beginners and gaming enthusiasts alike.


### [3.Python-Quiz-App](https://github.com/ishitabhatt0312/Python-Quiz-App)

A Python Quiz App tests users' knowledge with interactive questions. It displays questions, collects answers, tracks scores, and provides feedback. Features can include timers, difficulty levels, and random question order. Built using libraries like tkinter or as a command-line tool, itâ€™s customizable and user-friendly.

### [4.GUI-Calculator](https://github.com/ishitabhatt0312/GUI-Calculator)

A GUI Calculator is a user-friendly application with a graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Built using Python libraries like tkinter or PyQt, it features buttons for digits, operations, and clear/reset functions. It displays input and results in a text box, mimicking a physical calculator.
